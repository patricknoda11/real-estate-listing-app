        <strong>About the Developer</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I'm Patrick Noda, currently in my third year of Computer Science at the
        University of British Columbia. My journey in software development,
        particularly through my role as a Full-Stack Software Engineer at
        OnTraccr Technologies, has been a rewarding learning experience. There,
        I've been fortunate to contribute to developing features for our users,
        working with technologies like ReactJs, React Native, and HapiJs. My
        involvement in testing processes, including load and unit testing with
        tools such as K6 and Jest, has helped me understand the importance of
        creating reliable software. The Real Estate Listing Application, to
        which I've been contributing since January 2022, is a project that I
        hold close to my heart. Launched in early 2022, it has been a platform
        for continuous learning and improvement for me.
        <br />
        <br />
        This application showcases a full-stack design, client-server
        interactions, and database management. It's a reflection not just of
        technical skills, but also of a commitment to creating software that
        meets user needs and keeps pace with industry trends. I'm always eager
        to learn and grow, and I welcome feedback and ideas that can help evolve
        this platform.
        <br />
        <br />I invite you to connect with me on GitHub and LinkedIn to learn
        more about my professional path and projects. Feel free to explore my
        portfolio for a closer look at my work and its impact in the field of
        computer science.
